                    <p>For sunshine these these big leafy boys needs bright indirect light to prevent sun burn on the
                        leaves.
                        These guys are picky with their tempeture, they like to be between
                        65-75 degrees farenheight.</p>
                    <p> As for the soil and fertalization these plants respond well to a 20-20-20 liquid fertalizer
                        durrinng
                        growing season

                    <p>These cool plants are known for their deep purple colour and triangular shaped leaves often in
                        groups of
                        three.
                        These guys also bloom flowers every so often. These guys need a very even soil moisture level,
                        especailly when they are just a small plant.
                        Although, eventually when the plant is older they do have a higher drout tollerance. </p>
                    <p>Oxailias plants are very photosensitive plants, meaning that at night and on cloudy days the
                        leaves will
                        fold inwards and close up, but
                        in bright day light they will open wide to collect lots of light. </p>
                    <p> These guys will benifit from a slow release and or liquid feritlizer durring growing season.
                        Mixing in
                        some compost might also help this plant out.</p>

                    <p>These plants are specail because they do not require any sort of soil to grow, they grow in the
                        air
                        (hence their name).</p>
                    <p>These guys water needs are very interesting, they require frequent watering. Since there is no
                        soil you
                        can't use the regular watering method,
                        you will need to soak them in distiled water for 20-40 minutes every few weeks. Although
                        depending on
                        the specific air plant they might prefer
                        a light misting instead of a soak. </p>
                    <p>For sunshine since these plants are usually found on other trees or in the shade of rocks they
                        dont like
                        a ton of light they prefer to have bright to medium
                        indirect light.</p>
                    <p> Since this plant does not require soil and won't do so will if you soil it fertilizing is not
                        really a
                        tast that this plant needs to survive. But, this Plant
                        does sometimes like to be potted in moss and adapt to soil so it is not recomended to put them
                        in soil.</p>
